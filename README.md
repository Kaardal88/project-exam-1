This is my first year exam. 
I have made a blog for learning and teaching about the actual thing I'm studying. 

I used wordpress REST API setting up the blogposts like a database. Then I used javascript making the api call so I can display the posts on my own website. 

Being a rather creative human being, I spent some time making the design look good. Using animation, keyframes, color palettes, illustration and fonts to put it all togheter.
